    "> - Use IN when you are talking about a **small** or **personal** vehicle that has a **compartment** that surrounds you, such as a car, a taxi, a van, a train, an airplane, a helicopter, a submarine, or a spaceship.\n",
    "> - Use ON when you are talking about a **large** or **public** vehicle that allows you to **move around freely** inside it, such as a bus, a boat, a ship, a roller coaster, or a plane.\n",

    "> \n",
    "> These are not absolute rules, and there may be some exceptions or variations depending on the context or the type of vehicle. For example, you can say that you are IN a canoe or a kayak, even though they are small and open, because you are sitting inside them. You can also say that you are ON a yacht or a cruise ship, even though they are large and enclosed, because you can walk around on them.\n",
